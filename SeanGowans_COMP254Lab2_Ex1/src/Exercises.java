  /** Returns the sum of the integers in given array. */
  // Running time: O(n)
  // Explanation: the method uses a single loop that iterates once for each element in the array.
  public static int example1(int[] arr) {
    int n = arr.length, total = 0;
    for (int j=0; j < n; j++)       // loop from 0 to n-1
      total += arr[j];
    return total;
  }

  /** Returns the sum of the integers with even index in given array. */
  // Running time: O(n)
  // Explanation: the loop iterates through the array with a step of 2, which results in about n/2
  // iterations; constants are ignored in Big-Oh notation, so the running time is linear.
  public static int example2(int[] arr) {
    int n = arr.length, total = 0;
    for (int j=0; j < n; j += 2)    // note the increment of 2
      total += arr[j];
    return total;
  }

  /** Returns the sum of the prefix sums of given array. */
  // Running time: O(n^2)
  // Explanation: there are two nested loops, where the inner loop runs from 0 to j for each j.
  // The total number of iterations is proportional to n^2.
  public static int example3(int[] arr) {
    int n = arr.length, total = 0;
    for (int j=0; j < n; j++)       // loop from 0 to n-1
      for (int k=0; k <= j; k++)    // loop from 0 to j
        total += arr[j];
    return total;
  }

  /** Returns the sum of the prefix sums of given array. */
  // Running time: O(n)
  // Explanation: the method uses a single loop with constant-time operations inside, resulting in linear running time.
  public static int example4(int[] arr) {
    int n = arr.length, prefix = 0, total = 0;
    for (int j=0; j < n; j++) {     // loop from 0 to n-1
      prefix += arr[j];
      total += prefix;
    }
    return total;
  }

  /** Returns the number of times second array stores sum of prefix sums from first. */
  // Running time: O(n^3)
  // Explanation: the method contains three nested loops. The outer loop runs n times, and the
  // two inner loops together perform O(n^2) work, giving a total running time of O(n^3).
  public static int example5(int[] first, int[] second) { // assume equal-length arrays
    int n = first.length, count = 0;
    for (int i=0; i < n; i++) {     // loop from 0 to n-1
      int total = 0;

        for (int k=0; k <= j; k++)  // loop from 0 to j
